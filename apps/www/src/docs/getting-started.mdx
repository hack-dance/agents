# Introduction
A collection of AI utilities, hooks, and abstractions for building AI agents with OpenAI.

### This is not a Typical NPM Package. What's the Deal?

Inspired by the model introduced by <Link href="https://ui.shadcn.com">shadcn</Link>, this isn't an npm package you'll add as a dependency. Instead it is just a collection of utilities, hooks, and abstractions that you can directly integrate into your codebase.

### How Do I Use It?
1. **Select What You Need**: Explore the documentation and select the things that align with your project goals.
2. **Copy, Paste**:  Copy the code into your project. This code is now yoursâ€”feel free to customize.
3. **CLI**: We provide a CLI that copies the parts of the toolkit you want, into your project.

## Why This Approach?
- **Complete Control**: Pick only what you need, avoid the bloat that comes with unwanted functionality.
- **Flexibility**: With the code integrated into your project, you have the freedom to modify and extend it as you wish.


Consider this as a starting point for building new AI projects, or use it as a reference to build your own set of AI tools.
