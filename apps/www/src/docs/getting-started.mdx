  <AlertDescription>
    These docs are not 100% complete yet. Im working on this in my spare time.
    If anything is unclear, or broken, please reach out on twitter or create an issue on Github.

    For now, all of code is in typescript and the examples assume Next.js 13+.

    I will be adding more examples, ability to specify js or ts, and how to integrate into a few different frameworks.

    Thanks for your patience!

# Introduction
A collection of AI utilities, hooks, and abstractions for building AI agents with OpenAI.

### This is not a Typical NPM Package. What's the Deal?

Inspired by the model introduced by <Link href="https://ui.shadcn.com">shadcn</Link>, this isn't an npm package you'll add as a dependency. Instead it is just a collection of utilities, hooks, and abstractions that you can directly integrate into your codebase.

### How Do I Use It?
1. **Select What You Need**: Explore the documentation and select the things that align with your project goals.
2. **Copy, Paste**:  Copy the code into your project. This code is now yoursâ€”feel free to customize.
3. **CLI**: We provide a CLI that copies the parts of the toolkit you want, into your project.

## Why This Approach?
- **Complete Control**: Pick only what you need, avoid the bloat that comes with unwanted functionality.
- **Flexibility**: With the code integrated into your project, you have the freedom to modify and extend it as you wish.


Consider this as a starting point for building new AI projects, or use it as a reference to build your own set of AI tools.
