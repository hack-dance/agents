  <AlertDescription>
    These docs are not 100% complete yet. Im working on this in my spare time.
    If anything is unclear, or broken, please reach out on twitter or create an issue on Github.

    For now, all of code is in typescript and the examples assume Next.js 13+.

    I will be adding more examples, ability to specify js or ts, and how to integrate into a few different frameworks.

    Thanks for your patience!

# Introduction
A collection of AI utilities, hooks, and abstractions for building AI agents with OpenAI.


This toolkit can be broken into two parts: **Agents** & **Hooks**
Each are available to use either via npm or by copying the code directly into your project with our CLI.


## Agents
Agents are the core of this toolkit. They are the building blocks for creating AI agents that can interact with OpenAI's API.


## Hooks
Hooks are a set of React hooks that can be used to interact with AI agents in your React applications.


Consider this as a starting point for building new AI projects, or use it as a reference to build your own set of AI tools.
